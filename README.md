Aka "dream catcher"

A Project Tango app that enables you to pinpoint issues on a construction site, then send their 3D coordinates up to
[Flux.io](https://flux.io) and share them with contractors, architects, engineers or other relevant people.

To use the app you'll need to set up the OIDCLib configuration properly, which involves [creating an OIDC client with
Flux](https://flux.io/developer/apps/). _Make sure you enable javascript in the OIDC web view._

You'll also need a [Project Tango device](https://get.google.com/tango/) and a Flux account.

This project was inspired by and made in collaboration with the awesome people of [FinalCAD](http://www.finalcad.com/).

Many thanks to Damon and Chris of [AEC Hackathon](http://aechackathon.com/) for organising the Singapore event.
